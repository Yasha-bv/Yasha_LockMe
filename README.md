# Yasha_Lockme
LockMe is a console-based application that is developed in order to help the user store his/her credentials in one place and can fetch it anytime. This app provides Registration and 
Login functionalities for the user. Once the user registers and logs in into the app, user will find options to store or fetch credentials. User can store credentials for different 
sites and applications and after storing them successfully, he/she can retrieve it from the Fetch functionality. 

In addition to this, user has the liberty to add and delete files in the system. User can view all the files in the system or can search for a particular one. Listing of all the files
is done in ascending order which is done with help of Linked List. Searching is done with the help of linear search. 


Tech stack:	 
Language used- Java. 
File Handling.
Data structure used- Linear Search for searching,
                   - Linked List for Sorting of the files in ascending by their names.
                   
                   
Below is the Sprint Plan

Sprint 1  
As a user i want lockme digital locker so that i can store my credentials. 
As a user i want registration page so that i can access lockme app. 
As a user i want login page to authenticate a user to access lockme app. 
As a developer I want to build registration page to enter user in system. 
As a developer I want to build login page so that we can authenticate user. 
As a developer I want to create user interaction with console input. 

Sprint 2
